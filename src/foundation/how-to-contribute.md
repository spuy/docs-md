At the same time, contributions of your intelligence and effort are the priceless - contributions from developers around the world have made this software project so valuable and powerful.  If you can write code, you can start to contribute today by making a pull request that fixes a but or adds a feature.  If you can write technical documents, please contribute to the documentation.  If you sell services related to ADempiere or use it in your business, advocate for the project on your websites.  Spread the word.
